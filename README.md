# Life Expectancy at Birth

### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to study the life expectancy at birth of various countries. By analysing various aspects of this dataset, we will gain insights to the trends, compare different countries and totally understand the various factors that contribute to this findings

### Data Sources
The primary source used for this project is the 'Life_expectancy_by_country.xlsx' file

### Tools
- Excel 

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the data preparation phase, I did the following tasks:
1. Data Loading and inspection
2. Handled missing values
3. Removed duplicates


### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA Analysis was done to answer the following key questions:

1. What is the highest and lowest life expectancy by country
2. What is the highest life expectancy by year
3. Which year was the life expectancy the highest based on each country

### Data Analysis
The following things were done during my data analysis
- I removed the "Country Code" column as it was deemed unnecessary to the dataset
- I added filter to the dataset
- I transformed the data into a table
- I used pivot table to analyse the various aspects of the data

### Results/Findings
The following findings were made from the dataset:
1. Bermuda has the highest Life Expectancy by country
2. Angola has the lowest life expectancy by country
3. African countires has by average the lowest life expectancies
4. The average life expectancies of each countries increases as the year increase

### Recommendations
1. Policy makers and researchers should use this data to gain insights into the health status of different countries
2. Health institutions can usse this data as a reference point to compare different levels of life expectancy and to use this data to monitor changes overtime
3.
